# PAIR PROGRAMMING
It is an arrangement where 2 people sit together and tackle programming tasks.
The aim of such an arrangement is to ease problem solving when working on a project.

## HOW IT WORKS
1. The 2 members of the pair come-up with two differnt ideas about a project and try to sell their concept to each other. Thereafter, they agree on a mutual idea based on the concepts they brought up initially.
2. The 2 members of the pair can work on diffent projects but they unblock each other when one is stuck.
